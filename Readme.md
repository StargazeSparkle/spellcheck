# Spellcheck
Spellcheck is an experimental bot written in Common Lisp and targeting FANDOM wikis running on the UCP. This bot aims to tracks users through the Recent Changes feed in order to inspect their edits and point out spelling mistakes made in their diffs. This could serve a purpose on some communities but really this software was just developed in order to get some concrete practice working with Common Lisp.

1. Install SBCL
2. Install Quicklisp
3. Clone this repository into your `~/common-lisp` directory
